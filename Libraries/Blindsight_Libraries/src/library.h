   * A pipe is an address to which you can write. A simple analogy to understand how the NRF24 handles channels and
   * pipes is a mailbox in a multi-story building. All the mail comes through the same slot in the
   * front entrance (channel). A clerk picks up the mail and places it in the correct mailbox (pipe). Each node has
   * its own pipe and they all listen to the same channel.
   *
   * The pipe to which the master writes must match the pipe to which the slave listens to.
   * The master iterates through a list of pipes, writes to each one the intensity of the corresponding motor, waits
   * for the slave to acknowledge receipt and continues to the next pipe.
   *
   * Communication should only occur when there has been a change in vibration intensity.
