# Blindsight MQP

This repository hosts the code for the Blindsight MQP '19. Blindsight is an assistive navigation for the blind. It uses ultrasonic sensors mounted on a pair of 3D printed glasses to detect head-level objects. The device communicates with two vibrating modules using Nordic Semi NRF24 communication modules. The vibrating modules are wrist-worn devices that contain vibrating motors to give an indication of the distance to nearby obstacles.

## Getting Started

Visit the Blindsight website and follow the instructions to get started on building your own prototype.

### Prerequisites

In order to program your prototype you'll need to install the Arduino IDE and drivers. The code is written for the ATmega328 platform (UNO, Nano, Mini).

### Installing

Upon downloading the files, place the Blindsight_Library folder inside the Arduino->libraries folder. This will install the Blindsight_Library in your Arduino environment.
